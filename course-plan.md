# Course Plan 

The format of the course is as follows: 

* By Monday each week, complete the asynchronous portions of that week's material (read the readings and watch the videos). 
* Monday, meet in section with your TA. 
* Wednesday, meet as a class for lecture. 

(On the first week of class, we will meet in lecture both Monday and Wednesday. You'll then be assigned to a section, which will meet Mondays from Week 2 on.)
